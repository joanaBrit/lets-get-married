## Project Management:

This project is a way to practice my skills and continue learning new ones. I'm exploring React in a different way, using `Storybook` to visualize components instead of rendering the entire app in the browser every time. I also plan to explore `AI` further.

The idea for this project came from a desire to help society and my friends - many of whom are getting married. I thought this could be a useful platform for them to create something tailored to their taste, using the language they prefer, without worrying about spelling mistakes, and to promote their special day.

Above all, the main goal is to practice, learn and grow as a developer. ðŸš€
