        "There are 3 possible places you may consider - Brindisi, Bari, and Lecce.<br><br>The closest airport to the venue is <strong>Brindisi</strong> Airport. There are direct flights from London served by Ryanair. It is the most convenient, but has less accommodation and tourism options in the city itself.<br><br>Alternatively, you may choose to fly to <strong>Bari</strong>, the capital of Puglia region. It is a larger city, and is also connected by rail to Brindisi. Services run almost every hour, including weekends. The one hour journey by Trenitalia costs ‚Ç¨10.<br><br>Lastly, you may also consider <strong>Lecce</strong>, a larger city south of Brindisi. There are no direct flights to the city, but regular rail services run from Brindisi station to Lecce, with 30m of travel at ‚Ç¨3.40.",
